# AnnoFusion: My Project Title

## Project Introduction：
ISAT is a semi-automatic image annotation tool designed to accelerate the creation of high-quality training data for computer vision. Built on PyQt5 and integrated with deep learning models, it supports tasks like semantic segmentation, object detection, and keypoint annotation, combining automated proposals with efficient human-in-the-loop refinement.

##  Environmental dependence：
Python 3.10+  
Please refer to the required dependencies `requirements.txt`.

Installation method:
`bash、
pip install -r requirements.txt

train：
python train.py

Instructions for use：
##  Instructions for use：

First, you need to select the task, and at this point, you can simply choose the corresponding weight file.
The weight for the semantic segmentation task is best.th; the weight for the object detection and keypoint recognition tasks is selected from yolo.pt.
I hope these have helped you.
